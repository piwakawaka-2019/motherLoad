                        <h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit)</h3>

                        <p>
                            The CPU is the brain of the computer it runs all of the calculations for the computer.
                        </p>

                        <h3>CPU Cooler</h3>

                        <p>
                            This cools down the CPU so it can run at an optimal temperature to ensure that it doesn’t overheat 
                            and cause damage to the CPU or more. There are different types of cooling systems:
                        </p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Liquid cooling:</strong> a liquid cooling block is usually connected to the CPU and has a reservoir of extra 
                                coolant waiting to be used to cool down the CPU.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>Fan cooling:</strong> Typically when using fan cooling you would have a heatsink attached to the fan, and the 
                                heatsink is what gets attached to the CPU using thermal paste/compound, which helps dissipate the heat. 
                            </li>

                        </ul>

                        <h3>Motherboard</h3>

                        <p>
                            The motherboard holds the CPU (Central Processing Unit), RAM (Random Access Memory) as well as input/output devices like storage, 
                            keyboards, mice, etc. It also allows for easier communication between the parts in and out of the computer.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Memory (RAM)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Makes it easier to run multiple applications or applications that require more resources/power to run. 
                        </p>

                        <h3>Storage</h3>

                        <p>
                            Holds your files, such as games, programs and documents. There are different types of storage such as HDD 
                            (Hard Disc Drive), SSD (Solid State Drive), SSHD (Solid State Hybrid Drive).
                        </p>

                        <ul>

                            <li>
                                <strong>HDD (Hard Disc Drive):</strong> A HDD or often referred to as a hard drive is the typical storage 
                                that you might find in a laptop. You would also typically find a hard drive in a computer that would have 
                                multiple options to store your files.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>SSD (Solid State Drive):</strong>  Unlike a hard drive an SSD doesn’t have any moving parts and stores 
                                its information by using “flash memory”, which will keep all its data/information when there is no power supplied. 
                                Because of the way this storage works you get faster speeds when reading and writing data to the SSD.
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                <strong>SSHD (Solid State Hybrid Drive):</strong> SSHDs combines both SSDs and HDDs. You’re able to store data on the 
                                SSD side of the hybrid drive which people often use for storing their operating system. The HDD side of the hybrid drive is 
                                often used as a normal hard drive. Often there is a cache with this which will read often used blocks on the hard drive and 
                                store that data on the SSD portion of the hybrid drive for faster reading and writing.
                            </li>

                        <h3>Graphics Card</h3>

                        <p>
                            A graphics card is what displays graphics/information to the screen. It also does calculations just like the CPU but does it at a 
                            more efficient and faster rate in deciding on how to display your content.

                        <h3>Power Supply (PSU)</h3>

                        <p>
                            Power Supply (PSU): The power supply draws power from the wall to supply your computer with enough power in order for it to run 
                            and operate with what you’re doing. It’s often a good idea to get one that’ll easily supply more power to the computer incase 
                            you are doing heavy work.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Optical Driver</h3>

                        <p> 
                            An optical drive is what allows you to read and write to a disc. But because of the internet, these are quickly becoming unneeded.
